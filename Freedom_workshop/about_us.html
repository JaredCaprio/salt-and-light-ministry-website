            About Debbie Friley Debbie Friley, founder of the ”Salt & Light”
            Discipleship Ministry and the Freedom Workshop, has served full-time
            with The Navigators since 1984. Employing her remarkable gifts of
            evangelism & discipleship, Debbie has spent the past 35 years
            ministering to women through the message of the Gospel, one-on-one
            discipleship, Bible study groups and Leadership training. She has
            enjoyed the tremendous privilege of reproducing and multiplying
            countless disciples of Christ.
          </p>
          <p>
            Debbie has lived in Australia, doing evangelism and discipleship
            with her ministry team. During her time there she saw many come to
            Christ and a wonderful church was birthed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Debbie also spent almost four years as part of the co-mission
            project, living in Blagoveshchensk, Russia, a small city located in
            eastern Siberia where she “enjoyed” 40 below zero weather! While in
            Russia, she taught courses in Christian morals and ethics in their
            public schools, led women's Bible studies (including one for
            English-speaking university students which drew many unbelievers)
            and assisted in establishing a church for the new believers in that
            city. Due to government restrictions Debbie was prevented from
            returning full time but has traveled in and out of Blagoveshchensk
            on a tourist visa to minister to the Russians through evangelism,
            discipleship, mentoring and coaching.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 1999, Debbie also began traveling to China, ministering to the
            Chinese people. She has worked in the cities of Shanghai, Xian,
            Hangzhou and Ningbo; equipping local Christians and working with
            underground church leaders and has taught many conferences for
            international college students. Over 50 countries were represented
            each time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Debbie spent February and March of 2006 in Scotland, Ireland,
            England relationship building and in China, sharing the Gospel and
            introducing the Salt & Light Discipleship ministry and Freedom
            message. In November of 2007 Debbie traveled to Nicaragua for their
            International Women’s Conference. She was the main speaker at the
            conference with over 600 women in attendance. Debbie was accompanied
            by a team of women she has mentored and trained to lead Salt & Light
            workshops. Debbie’s Salt & Light team then trained the local
            Nicaraguan women to lead Salt & Light Discipleship groups. God used
            this training to birth over 100 weekly Salt & Light Discipleship
            groups who are now reading through the Bible, memorizing Scripture,
            and studying the Bible using the Bible!
          </p>
          <p>
            Debbie has also taken a team of trained leaders to Wiesbaden,
            Germany to present the Freedom Workshop and to introduce the Salt &
            Light Discipleship ministry there.
          </p>
          <p>
            When Debbie is not traveling internationally, she is taking the
            Freedom Workshop and Salt & Light Discipleship ministry to many
            states across the USA. Her local Salt & Light groups meet weekly and
            also support a local ministry whose mission is to assist victims of
            sex trafficking.
          </p>
          <p>
            While at home in St. Petersburg, Debbie stays in close contact with
            many of her lifelong friends around the world. She also continues
            her involvement in outreach, Bible studies, one on one Biblical
            Counseling, leadership training and speaking. Her speaking ministry
            includes "I'm Stuck, but I Want to be Free." This powerful and
            life-changing message from the book of Romans and Galatians is known
            as the Freedom Workshop.
          </p>
          <p>
            Much of Debbie’s ministry is centered on both leading and equipping
            leaders and other churches to host Salt & Light Discipleship Groups.
            Salt & Light groups meet weekly learning to be “self-feeding”
            Christians by reading through the entire Bible at their own pace,
            memorizing Scripture and studying books of the Bible as a team. They
            meet as a team because as Debbie says, referring to Ecclesiastes
            4:9-11, “we are better together”. These Salt & Light groups continue
            to multiply and grow all over the United States and abroad
            contributing to the fulfillment of the Great Commission in Matthew
            28:18-20 and 2 Timothy 2:2. This ministry is truly a work of God.
            She welcomes any newcomers.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Salt & Light Discipleship ministry & Freedom Workshop is now in
            Russia, China, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Canada, Papua New Guinea, Bali,
            many Florida cities and all over the US. Debbie also is a speaker at
            large and travels all over the U.S.A. & the world bringing the Truth
            of God's Word. Debbie worships and ministers at Calvary Chapel when
            she is not ministering elsewhere in her hometown in the city of St.
            Petersburg, Florida or somewhere ministering in the U.S. or
            overseas. Debbie is available to introduce Salt & Light Discipleship
            ministry and coach the leadership to begin small groups. She’s also
            available to teach a 2 day Freedom Conference, a “How To”: “I’m
            Stuck, but I want to be Free.” In addition, Debbie is available to
            do conferences as well as workshops.
          </p>
          <p>
            Debbie enjoys cycling, photography and calligraphy. Her photo cards
            are called “Worth a Thousand Words” (Prayed for Pictures) and
            calligraphy cards, “Life Giving Words”. She pens words from the
            Scriptures to go with her beautiful photo cards. You can also find
            Debbie cycling around town with friends doing what she fondly calls
            “Discycleship”, playing her guitar, or hanging out with her beloved
            nieces and nephews.
